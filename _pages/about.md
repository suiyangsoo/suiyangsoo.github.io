I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate in the [School of Statistics and Management](https://ssm.sufe.edu.cn) at [SUFE](https://www.sufe.edu.cn). I am currently working with Professor [Yang Bai](https://ssm.sufe.edu.cn/ce/79/c712a118393/page.htm). Prior to join SUFE, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree from School of Mathematics and Statistics at Central South University in 2020.

My research focuses on tensor statistics and reinforcement learning.
